# Kuralist Development Status & Important Notes

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Working Components
- **Authentication Flow**: [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/authentication/AuthScreen.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/authentication/AuthScreen.kt) and [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/authentication/AuthViewModel.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/authentication/AuthViewModel.kt)
- **Navigation Structure**: [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/application/MainAppScreen.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/application/MainAppScreen.kt) with bottom tabs
- **Supabase Integration**: [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/SupabaseManager.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/SupabaseManager.kt) configured and working
- **Room Database**: [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/database/SchoolDatabase.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/database/SchoolDatabase.kt) with proper annotations

### ðŸš§ Temporary Implementations (Need Completion)
- **School List Screen**: [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/schoollist/SchoolListScreen.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/schoollist/SchoolListScreen.kt) - Currently shows placeholder content
- **Hilt Dependency Injection**: Commented out to prevent build issues, needs re-implementation
- **Database Integration**: Full integration with [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/SchoolService.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/SchoolService.kt) pending

### ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes Applied
1. **Crash Fix**: Resolved app crash on sign-in by simplifying [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/schoollist/SchoolListScreen.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/schoollist/SchoolListScreen.kt)
2. **Text Input Fix**: Fixed email/password field state management using `remember` pattern
3. **Build Configuration**: Re-enabled kapt and Room compiler in [app/build.gradle.kts](mdc:app/build.gradle.kts)
4. **Import Issues**: Added missing imports for [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/SchoolService.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/SchoolService.kt)

## Important TODOs

### High Priority
1. **Re-implement School List**: Replace placeholder in [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/schoollist/SchoolListScreen.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/features/schoollist/SchoolListScreen.kt) with full functionality
2. **Enable Hilt DI**: Restore dependency injection throughout the app
3. **Database Operations**: Implement proper school data loading from Supabase to Room

### Medium Priority
1. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling to [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/SchoolService.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/core/services/SchoolService.kt)
2. **Search & Filtering**: Implement search functionality using [app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/shared/views/SearchBar.kt](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/kuralist/app/shared/views/SearchBar.kt)
3. **Map Integration**: Complete Google Maps implementation in map screen

## Build & Development Notes
- **Gradle**: Uses version catalogs in [gradle/libs.versions.toml](mdc:gradle/libs.versions.toml)
- **Kotlin**: Language version 2.0+ with kapt fallback to 1.9
- **Room Compiler**: Required for database functionality - ensure kapt is enabled
- **API Keys**: Configured in [app/build.gradle.kts](mdc:app/build.gradle.kts) build config fields
